What is odontux :
Odontux wants to be a open-source application for a dental practice.

Required :
What does it need :
	* bash : for command-line interface
	* python : odontux-core is written in that language
	* sqlalchemy : for database access
	* postgresql : that may be change to sqlite or others, in model/__init__.py

What will it need :
	* gnucash libdbd-pgsql python-gnucash
	* gimp
	* remind
	* ...


How to :

create a directory with odontux, cloning the git :
	$ git clone https://github.com/fluxspir/odontux

First, create a postgresql database ; for example :
	$ sudo -u postgres createuser -P my_user              (you may respond "no" to all 3 questions)
	$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O my_user odontux
	$ sudo -u postgres createdb -O my_user professionnal_accounting          (for gnucash accounting purpose)

Then write in ~/.odontuxrc :
	[db]
	url = postgresql+psycopg2://my_user:password@127.0.0.1/odontux
	[gnucashdb]
	url = postgres://my_user:password@127.0.0.1/professionnal_accounting


Start gnucash, create a "new file", in "business account", save it to postgresql "professionnal_accounting", erasing the existing one you just manually created.
I strongly advice to read gnucash doc to know how to use it, since the accounting side will be done directly in gnucash, ouside of odontux.
The business part of gnucash begins at chapter 12 (Account receivable) ; but having read all the manual (even the parts before for a home-user accounting) will probably be necessary to understand and use gnucash for the dental office accounting the most efficiently.
Odontux will "speak" with gnucash db only to add incomes from patient after the acts made by dentist. All the rest may be done directly in gnucash.

Link the bash_dots_odontux in ~ (not mandatory, adapt after if you are not)
	$ cd ~
	$ ln -s path/to/odontux/bashodontuxrc .bashodontuxrc
	$ ln -s path/to/odontux/bashodontuxcolours .bashodontuxcolours
	$ ln -s path/to/odontux/bashodontuxaliases .bashodontuxaliases

Start odontux shell
	$ bash --rcfile ~/.bashodontuxrc

	$ odontux createdb.py

Odontux Commands : 
First, add yourself ; you are the "user" ; they could be different kind of "user" in the office (dentist, hygienist, nurse, secretary...) ; the access to db will be later be separated for every kind of user.Then, add a medecine_doctor (not the dentist, which is "you"), the one of the first patient you want to add
And then, add a dental_office (this probably will be you, or the dental office you work in)
	
	$ odontux add_user -h
	$ odontux add_md -h  
	$ odontux add_dental_office -h
	$ odontux list_md   â†’   get the "id" of the doc (probably "1", for the first doc you created)
	$ odontux add_patient -h
	$ odontux list_patient patient name
	$ switch_patient "patient_id"
	$ {next,prev}appointment
